# SmartFind - Community Notification System

## ‚úÖ **Notification System Overview:**

The system now sends real-time notifications to ALL users whenever someone reports a lost or found item. This creates a community-driven lost and found platform where everyone stays informed.

## **How It Works:**

### **1. When Someone Reports a Found Item:**
- User fills out the "I Found Something" form
- System creates the find record in database
- **Notification sent to ALL users** with:
  - üîç "Item Found: [Item Name]"
  - Location where found
  - Contact information
  - Image (if uploaded)

### **2. When Someone Reports a Lost Item:**
- User fills out the "I Lost Something" form
- System creates the loss record in database
- **Notification sent to ALL users** with:
  - üì± "Item Lost: [Item Name]"
  - Location where lost
  - Owner details
  - Contact information

### **3. Notification Display:**
- **Bell Icon** in dashboard header with unread count badge
- **Click bell** to see all notifications
- **Real-time updates** when new items are reported
- **Mark as read** functionality
- **Time stamps** showing when notification was sent

## **Database Schema:**

### **Notifications Table:**
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key to users)
- type (find/loss/match/system)
- title (e.g., "üîç Item Found: iPhone 13")
- message (detailed description)
- item_name (name of the item)
- location (where found/lost)
- date_occurred (date of incident)
- contact_info (how to reach person)
- image_url (photo if available)
- is_read (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at
```

## **Setup Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**

3. `database/notifications_schema.sql` (notifications table)
4. `database/storage_setup.sql` (avatar storage)
5. `database/find_images_storage.sql` (find image storage)

### **Step 2: Test the Complete Flow**
1. **Register multiple users** (create 2-3 test accounts)
2. **User 1 reports found item** ‚Üí All users get notification
3. **User 2 reports lost item** ‚Üí All users get notification
4. **Check notification bell** ‚Üí See unread count and notifications
5. **Click notifications** ‚Üí Mark as read

## **Key Features:**

#### **Integration Points:**
- **Find Form**: Sends notification after successful submission
- **Loss Form**: Sends notification after successful submission

- **Database**: Stores all notifications with proper relationships

## **User Journey:**

### **Complete Notification Flow:**
1. **User A reports found item** ‚Üí Form submitted successfully
2. **System sends notification** ‚Üí All users (A, B, C, D...) receive notification
3. **Users see bell badge** ‚Üí Red badge shows unread count
4. **Users click bell** ‚Üí See notification: "üîç Item Found: iPhone 13 in Central Park"
5. **Users can contact** ‚Üí Use provided contact information
6. **Mark as read** ‚Üí Notification becomes read, badge count decreases

### **Benefits:**
