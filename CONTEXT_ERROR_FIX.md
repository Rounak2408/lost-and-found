# Next.js useContext Error Fix

## **Issue Identified:**
The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')` occurs when React hooks are used in a context where React context is not properly initialized, typically during server-side rendering (SSR).

## **Root Cause:**
- `useRouter` from `next/navigation` being called during SSR
- `useContext` being called on `null` during server-side rendering
- Client/server component mismatch causing hydration issues

## **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Dynamic Import for NotificationBell**
```javascript
// Dynamically import NotificationBell to avoid SSR issues
const NotificationBell = dynamic(() => import('@/components/notification-bell').then(mod => ({ default: mod.NotificationBell })), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <div className="w-8 h-8" />
})
```

### **2. Client-Side Router Hook**
```javascript
// Create a client-side router hook
function useClientRouter() {
  const [router, setRouter] = useState<any>(null)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    import('next/navigation').then(({ useRouter }) => {
      setRouter(() => useRouter())
    })
  }, [])
  
  return router
}
```

### **3. Client-Side State Check**
```javascript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true)
}, [])
```

### **4. Conditional Rendering**
```javascript
// Only render components when on client side
{isClient && <NotificationBell userId={user.id} />}

// Only use router when available
onClick={() => router && router.push('/dashboard/find')}
```

### **5. Error Boundary**
```javascript
// Added ErrorBoundary component to catch any remaining context issues
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>{children}</Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## **How the Fix Works:**

### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Prevention**
- Components that use browser APIs are dynamically imported with `ssr: false`
- Client-side state prevents rendering until hydration is complete
- Router is only used after client-side initialization

### **Context Safety**
- Error boundary catches any remaining context issues
- Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- Proper loading states during initialization

### **Hydration Safety**
- Components only render when `isClient` is true
- Router functions are safely called with null checks
- Dynamic imports prevent SSR conflicts

## **Expected Result:**
After applying these fixes:
- ✅ No more `useContext` errors
- ✅ Proper client-side rendering
- ✅ Smooth hydration without mismatches
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## **Testing:**
1. **Refresh the page** - Should load without errors
2. **Navigate between pages** - Should work smoothly
3. **Check notification bell** - Should render properly
4. **Test all forms** - Should work without context issues

The error was caused by React hooks being called during server-side rendering where the React context wasn't properly initialized. The fixes ensure all client-side components are properly isolated and only render after hydration is complete.
