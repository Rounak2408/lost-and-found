# SmartFind - Database Authentication Setup

This project now uses direct database authentication instead of Supabase Auth. Here's how to set it up:

## Database Setup

1. **Run the SQL script** in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of database/users_table.sql
   ```

2. **The script will create:**
   - A `users` table with proper structure
   - Indexes for performance
   - Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
   - Sample test data (optional)

## How It Works

### User Registration
- Users fill out the signup form
- Data is validated client-side
- User data is inserted directly into the `users` table
- Password is hashed before storage
- Success/error popups provide feedback

### User Login
- Users enter email and password
- System checks credentials against database
- On success, user data is stored in localStorage
- User is redirected to profile page

### Profile Page
- Displays user information from database
- Shows account status and creation dates
- Provides sign-out functionality

## Features

✅ **Beautiful popup dialogs** for success/error messages
✅ **Form validation** with real-time feedback
✅ **Duplicate email detection** with helpful error messages
✅ **Loading states** with spinners
✅ **Responsive design** that works on all devices
✅ **Professional UI** using your existing component library

## Database Schema

The `users` table includes:
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `first_name`, `last_name`
- `email` (Unique)
- `phone`
- `password_hash`
- `is_active` (Boolean)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (Timestamps)

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed before storage
- Email addresses are unique
- User sessions are managed via localStorage
- All form inputs are validated

## Next Steps

1. Run the database setup script
2. Test user registration and login
3. Customize the profile page as needed
4. Add additional features like password reset, etc.
