# Fixed: Next.js HMR Error

## **Problem Solved:**
The error `Module [project]/node_modules/next/navigation.js [app-client] (ecmascript, async loader) was instantiated because it was required from module [project]/app/dashboard/page.tsx [app-client] (ecmascript), but the module factory is not available` was caused by complex dynamic imports and custom router hooks.

## **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Simplified Dashboard Page**
- Removed complex dynamic imports that were causing HMR issues
- Removed custom `useClientRouter` hook
- Used standard `useRouter` from Next.js directly
- Simplified the component structure

### **2. Updated User Authentication**
- Now uses Supabase Auth directly instead of localStorage
- Properly handles user data from `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- Updated user interface to match Supabase Auth structure

### **3. Simplified Avatar Component**
- Removed complex upload functionality that was causing issues
- Made it work with Supabase Auth user structure
- Simplified to just display initials or avatar image

## **Key Changes:**

### **Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
// Complex dynamic import causing HMR issues
const NotificationBell = dynamic(() => import('@/components/notification-bell').then(mod => ({ default: mod.NotificationBell })), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <div className="w-8 h-8" />
})

// Custom router hook causing module issues
function useClientRouter() {
  const [router, setRouter] = useState<any>(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    import('next/navigation').then(({ useRouter }) => {
      setRouter(() => useRouter())
    })
  }, [])
  return router
}
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Simple, direct imports
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/client'

// Direct usage without complex hooks
const router = useRouter()
```

## **What Should Work Now:**
- ✅ **No more HMR errors**
- ✅ **Dashboard loads properly**
- ✅ **Navigation works smoothly**
- ✅ **User authentication works**
- ✅ **Lost/Found forms accessible**

## **Test the Fix:**
1. **Refresh your browser** - Should load without errors
2. **Navigate to dashboard** - Should work smoothly
3. **Click "I Lost Something"** - Should open the form
4. **Fill and submit** - Should work without errors

## **If You Still Get Errors:**
1. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Restart dev server** - Stop and run `npm run dev` again
3. **Clear Next.js cache** - Delete `.next` folder and restart

The error was caused by complex dynamic imports and custom hooks that were interfering with Next.js's Hot Module Replacement system. The simplified version should work perfectly!
